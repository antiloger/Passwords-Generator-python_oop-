The password generator is a Python script that allows users to generate strong and secure passwords. The script is designed to be run in the terminal and prompts the user to enter various parameters such as the desired length of the password and whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

Once the user has provided the required parameters, the script generates a random password that satisfies the user's criteria. The generated password is then displayed in the terminal for the user to copy and use as needed.

The password generator is built using the Python programming language and makes use of various Python libraries such as random and string. The script is designed to be easy to use and can be run on any computer with Python installed.

Overall, the password generator is a useful tool for anyone who needs to generate strong and secure passwords on a regular basis.
